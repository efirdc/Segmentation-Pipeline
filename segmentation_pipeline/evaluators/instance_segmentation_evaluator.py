    Detection test as described in "Objective Evaluation of Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation
    using a Data Management and Processing Infrastructure"

    This metric was used in the MSSEG (2016) and MSSEG2 (2021) lesion segmentation challenges.

    Denote N as the number of target instances and M the number of predicted instances.

    Returns a boolean tensor of length N that is True if the ith target instance is detected
    by the M predicted instances.

    Args:
        overlap_histogram: A (N + 1, M + 1) array. Element [i, j] is the number of overlapping voxels
            between the ith target component and the jth predicted component.
            Component 0 is the background for both prediction and target.
        min_recall: Target instances that are not overlapped by min_recall of predicted instances
            are classified as not detected. Equivalent to the alpha parameter in the paper.
        contribution_threshold: The contribution of each predicted instance to the target instance is
            sorted in descending order. The predicted instances which contribute to the first
            contribution_theshold of the overlap have an additional precision requirement.
            Equivalent to the gamma parameter in the paper.
        min_precision: Predicted instances that are within the contribution_threshold have an
            additional min_precision requirement. This is equivalent to (1 - beta) in the paper.
